# Tinkers' Survival

![Tinker Survival Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wendall911/TinkerSurvival/master/src/main/resources/assets/tinkersurvival/textures/gui/logo.png)

A Minecraft 1.12+ mod designed to create an early game survival concept for
[Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct).

## Surviving Your First Night
Sleep isn't an option with Zombies running rampant throughout the world. You
have to hustle if you want to survive!

It is important to remember:

+ Vanilla and vanilla-like tools and weapons don't work. All tool progression
  is based around Tinkers' Construct tools and weapons.
+ Crude tools are necessary to create items needed for crafting Tinkers' tools.
+ Move fast or you will probably die.

### Gather Required Materials

You may notice right away some small piles of rocks lying randomly on the
ground throughout the world. Break these and gather, they are a valuable
resource. And needed for crafting tools.

Leaves will drop sticks. The drop rate is not great, but it will allow you to
get sticks. Use a knife if you want to increase drops.

Flint is essential for creating your first knife, the Crude Knife. You'll need
to find gravel and either craft into flint, or break it until you get some.

Plant fiber is a new drop when breaking grass with the knife. You'll need plant
fiber to craft plant string used in crafting both the Crude Axe, Crude Saw and
bandages.

## Features

     but removes that annoying crap.
